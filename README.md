# Human-Computer Interaction Development

This repository documents the complete process of developing an application/product using the **human-centered design process**, following the principles and methods of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

## 📄 Project Report

The full development process is detailed in the final report:  
[Final Report HCI.pdf](https://github.com/lfmvit/Human-Computer-Interaction-Development/blob/main/Final%20Report%20HCI.pdf)

The report covers:
- Needfinding interviews
- Requirement gathering and analysis
- Personas and scenarios
- Ideation and concept development
- Low-fidelity prototyping
- User testing and evaluation
- Iterative refinement
- High-fidelity prototyping

## 🛠️ Repository Structure

- `/`  
  Main repository folder containing the final report and project files.
- `/prototypes`  
  Prototypes developed during the process (low and high fidelity).
- `/docs`  
  Additional documentation, notes, and research materials.
- `/assets`  
  Images, diagrams, and other resources used in the project.

## 🚀 High-Fidelity Prototype

The high-fidelity prototype and assets are included in the repository.  
Refer to the `/prototypes` folder and the report for links and detailed descriptions.

## 📚 About

This project is a hands-on application of HCI and human-centered design methodologies.  
It demonstrates the end-to-end workflow from user research to the realization of an interactive prototype.
